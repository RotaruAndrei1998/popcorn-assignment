# Popcorn assignment - Consume Google Books API

This is a really simple web application that consumes the search functionality of the Google Books API.

## Deploy

If you want to test the application live, it's deployed on https://popcorn-assignment.rotaruandrei.com/.

## How to start the project?

1. Run npm install command

```
npm install
```

2. Go into root folder and run

```
npm run dev
```

3. Use the application

## Notes

The application has 2 pages: 1. Homepage 2. Reading List

This 2 are separate pages, although I could have chosen any implementation, I am thinking that having the reading list data and functions will stay better in a context.

Future improvements: generalize components, implement caching for the search, write more tests, improve CI/CD flow (automated tests, lint, pre-commit hooks)
